have notices os nearly fifty works given by Maittaire, Deme,
Panzer, Van Praet, and Hain. To this lot may be added two

printed works on all subjectS, save apparently the Classics:
and this between the years 1482 and -1501 ε after which date

expense os Fridericus Egmundt and Gerardus Barrevelt):
and at different times he had different partners associated
with him. His device is very striking; and in its varieties
is well known to book-collectors. A copy os this device,

sented with this volume to our subscribens. I'n the second
volume will be given a copy of the woodcut os Saint William
of York, which is on the final page in the Bodleian book. ’
In its time this Bodleian book has been the property of
two Yorkshiremen, men oi renown: Ralph Thoresby and
Marmaduke Fothergill. Thoresby describes it in the cata-

Nonjur0r³z and was superseded in his living in 1713. He
then retired first to Ponteiraet and afterwards to Massam
Street in Westminster, where he died in 1731.⁴ He be-
