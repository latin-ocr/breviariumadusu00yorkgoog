to it, and in Dr. Henderson’s list os York Service Books, that
ol153o; but, as stated above, it must be given to the year

column, and in size is 4 inches by 3.

This is a copy of the whole Breviary, in two volumes, but
made up of more than one edition, and with a Sarum Kalen-
dar. There is no title, and no imprint in either volume.
The date 1524, which is put on the outside by the binder, is
got srom the table lor finding the golden number in the
Kalendar, where it is the first year ol the series ol nineteen.
This, however, gives no authority whatever: for this Kalendar
is not of York use, and is printed in a type unlike all York
books known. A Kalendar, one exactly similar to it, is found
in a Sarum Breviary of 1524, now at Oscott, printed at Paris
for Fr. Byrckman¹ Certainly the main portions os these two
volumes (in lact, all of the Pars HyemaliS, and the Psalter
and Sanctorale ol the P. Estivalis) are ol an edition later
than this date. Most probably this book came out about
1555, in the reign of Philip and Mary.
