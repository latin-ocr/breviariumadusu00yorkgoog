Lepus to the clergy of England, exactly similar to that
in the Sarum Breviary of 1524, now in the Library os
Oscott College. (3) Psalter¹ and Commune exactly the
same as that in the Pars Hyemalis. (4) Sanctorale,
from the Annunciationto S. Saturninus, Signatures
Ait to ZZ, then the abbreviations sor ‘et' and ‘con,'
all in eights, and the abbreviation sor ‘us' in sevens.
Probably there is one folio wanting'at the end which
would have contained the imprint. This Psalter, Com-
mune and Sanctorale have, as the Pars HyemaliS,
double columns with 33 lines in each column. These

' two volumes are bound by Hayday, and lettered un-
fortunately Breviarium Eboraceuse. In size they are
five inches and three-eights by three and a hals: and in
the P. Estivalis in the Temporale, between the Saturday
aster Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, is inserted an
enormous Pye of 94 pages

This very valuable copy of the Breviary did not corne into
my hands till the greater part os this volume was
printed. The collation os it begins at col. 677.

Ennnsun.

At the request of the Editor of the llork Manual (Vol. lxiii. os this series)
attention is drawn to the fact that at p. 89 of that volume, in the Exequiae De·
functorum, Psalm cxliv„ ‘ Exaltabo te, Deus‚' has been printed instead os Psalm
xxix„ ‘Exaltabo te, Domine)
