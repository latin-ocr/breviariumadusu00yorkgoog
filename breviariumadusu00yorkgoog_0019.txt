In size it isa small octavo: in black letter: bound in
brown call, and wrongly lettered 1498. Each solio is
paginated in right-hand corner in red numerals: which,
excepting the 8 folios os the Kalendas, run through the
whole book.

The signatores are from 1 to 34 in eights: and 35 in
twelves. In this first series are included the Temporale,
Kalendar, Psalter, and Commune. The second series oi
signatores begins with the Sanctorale: a to x all in eights,
and y (y 2, y3, y4,y 5, y6) in tene. On verso osy 10 is
the woodcut oi S. William which concludes the volume.

The numbering at the top os each folio is very defective
between 190 and 198. This latter should be 200: and
allowing eight more for the 8 folios of the Kalendar, the
numeral 209 with which the first folio os the· Psalter clom-
mences comes exactly right. So that both by signatores and
by numbering the book proclaims itsels complete, with no
hiatus: although there are many things in other Breviaries
which are not in Y. eg. the Penitential Psalms It is six
inches high by lour broad: each solio has 2 columns, with
36 lines in each. On the title-page, in MS.. is a notice: ‘This
is not noted in Maittaire, therefore very rare. W.(?) Ames?
That this is an error we have shown above, p. viii. note. There
