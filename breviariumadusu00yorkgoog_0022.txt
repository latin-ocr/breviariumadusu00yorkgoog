title Ebo: has 2 columns to each page and 35 lines to each
column. Where itis cited, except in the Kalendar, in our re-
print, it represents all the five copies of this same edition. It
is whole bound in brown calf, has the stamp of York Minster
Library on the side, and on the flyleaf next before the title-
page has this inscription: Biblice Decani & Capituli Ebor.
Dono Dedit Rokby Scott Clicus, 1733. Its size is six inches
by four. Of B, K, and C the same description as that given of
E will hold good. L (British Museum, C 3 5 b) is the copy
which belonged to Mr. Gordon, by him bequeathed to Dr.
Raine. It has in MS. on the flyleaf the following: ‘Bre-
‘viary according to the use of York, an extremely rare book.
‘On the 9 June, 1534, Hen. viij. issued a proclamation com-
‘manding the pope’s name to be erased out of all prayers and
‘Church Books; in compliance with which the then possessor
‘of this Book has erased the word ‘⁴ papa '⁸ throughout, as I
‘have also observed in various MS. Missals &c And in Sep.
‘1538, he issued another proclamation for the abolition of
‘counterfeit Saints3 to comply with which the owner has crossed
‘out various passages and also cut out4 leaves containing the
‘Festum S. Thome d Becket—1 leaf in the Translatio sancti
‘Willelmi—and one leaf in the Festum S. Cuthberti.' There
is also this second note: ‘Wants the following leaveS, sig. e
‘vij. viij. f j. ij. in Pars 1. and g j. (it should be G j.) in part 3!
To this should be added that folio i 1 is also wanting, and it
is added in the catalogue. Strangely enough, on G 7 b and
two following leaves the lections for S. Wilfrid are not erased. .

R. FR. Rsoununr’s Erimon on 1526.

This volume, unhappily deficient, represents the Pars Es·
tivalis corresponding to the former volumes of the P. Hyema·
lis. It gives us the only text we have of that portion of this
1526 edition. It has neither title-page nor colophon nor
Kalendar: and the whole of the Temporale and Psalter
is gone, and much of the Commune. The first folio now
remaining is M j. (the service being the Commune pluri-
morum confessorum: M and N in eights, and Ο in tens, with
one hiatus, probably of 1 foli0. The Sanctorale begins a new
series of signatures from aa to vv, all in eights: on vv 8 b

the service is that of S. Edmrgndi Archiepiscopi (16 Now).
