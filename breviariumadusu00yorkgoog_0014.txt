‘THE Breviary, or Portiforium, according to the use ol Yorlr
is herewith presented to the Surtees Society: thus completing,
with the exception of the Horae, the reprints of the several
printed Service Books which belonged to the great Northern
Diocese.

Conceming the varying forms of the Breviary little defi-
nite information can be gathered from books. What Doctor
Neale said thirty years ago still remains true: ‘T lte History
‘of the Breviary, not only from the time that it came as a
‘book, so-called, into use, about 1050, but from the very
‘commencement of the gradual process of its formation, is
‘a great desideratum, perhaps the great desideratum, in
‘ ritualistic works’ ¹ And of English Breviaries in particular,
their forms and peculiarities, there is much lael< of accurate
knowledge. Mr. Maskell, in his invaluable work, Monumenta
Ritualia,2 Dr. Neale, in his Liturgiological Essays, and David
Laing, in his Preiace to the Breviarium Aberdonense,³ have
written most to the purpose. And something towards a
comparison of the Uses in England was attempted in the
learned but unhappily uncompleted reprint of the Sarum
Portiforium by Mt. Seager.⁴ Now that we are able to present
