to construet a perfect text by correcting it. The contractioris
indeed have been expanded, and the holy name of our Lord
is printed with large Capitals according to the custom of our
Society: otherwise there has been no deviation from the
original text. WordS, or letters, printed in Italic ¹type denote
that they are printed in red in the original ; the black letter
is represented by the Roman.

There are eleven other volumeS, portions or full copies,
of the York Breviary, eight of known dates and three un-
dated. Full notices of these will be found below: and
thanks to the great liberality of their owners, who have
accorded to me free use of them at my own leisure, their
texts are here collated with our original. They are all
later than 1493: one and one only dates from the reign
of Philip and Mary. The researches of the late Mr. DavieS,
sometime Townclerk of York, have given us a glimpse of
'an edition printed in France before 1510, which was sup·
plied to a York bookseller, Gerard Wansfort.¹ And it
is probable that one at least of the above-named undated
copies, that of Mr. Blew, is of this edition. A third issue,
apparently a large one, came from the press of Fr. Regnault
in 1526: and of this, six volumes are still in existence. The

fourth and last dated edition is of 1533: of which we possess ’

the two parts that constitute a perfect whole. Its correctness
and good arrangement might have led us to take it as the
original of our reprint: only it seemed on the whole advis-
able to reproduce of those with a known date the earliest
rather than the latest known edition.

The printer of the Bodleianbook deserves a passing
tribute. Johannes Hammanus‚ or as he called himself later
J. Hertzog, describes himself of Spires in the earliest book
we have of his printing: subsequently he speaks of Landau
as his own city, but he printed always at Venice. His
surname of Hamman recalls that of a more famous bearer
of the name, Jost Amman, the great engraver, who died at
Niirnberg infr 591. Like so many others of the early Venice
printerS, Hamman was evidently a man who took great pride
in his work. He describes himself as magister, exercising an
ars mirifica, vir solers, vir probatissimus, impressor famatissi-
