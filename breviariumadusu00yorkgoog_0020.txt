This is a copy of the whole Breviary in one volume, but
with many an ‘hiatus valde deflendus' It has neither title
nor general imprint: and the Kalendar is gone. The first
folio (unpaged) is a 2 ς folio 1 is gone, whether it were blank
or had the title. (1) Temporale. The first series os signatures
runs from a to r, all in eights: from Advent to Easter Eve.
The second series goes from aa to mm, all in eights, from Easter
Eve to the Commemoratione. But aftermm 8 b comes an hiatus
probably of 8 solios : and there also should have been placed
the Kalendar. (2) Psalter and Commune. Third series of sig-
natures from A i to M 8 b from Sunday Mattins to Commune
unius virginis. ‘The commune wants a part ol the service
‘unius virginis, all of plurimarum virginum and unius ma-
‘tronaez and another of unius virginis. Itis deficient in the
‘Commemoratio B. Marie Virginis, and it wants the Corn-
‘memorations of S. William, of SS. Peter and Paul, and
‘All Saints3 as separate services coming with special rubric
‘after the commemoratio B. Marie V. and before S. Andrew.
‘lt wants likewise a series os Benedictions' (MS. note by
Rev. W. J. Blew.) (3) Sanctorale begins on ccj. (aa and bb want-
ing), and runs on to hh 6 b (hh is signed hhij.) Here occurs
the only colophon in the volume. 01 Finis prime partis hujus
breviarii scilicet temporis hyemalis de sanctis, There then
occurs a terrible lacuna from aaj to oo 8 (112 folioslz pp and
qq are there in eights and vv xx and yy: rr j to tt 8 are
wanting, and of z solios 1, 2, 7 and 8 are wanting, and all that
would complete the services of S. Katherine S. Linus and
S. Saturninus. The book is 5} inches by 33, and has 2
columns in a page and 32 lines to each column. It is bound in
dark green morocco with a silver cross let in on either board.
