still the guardians of the trust. After Fothergill the next
known possessor of the book was one Edw. Jacob,¹ from
whom it passed in the year 1789 to the great collector
Richard Gough, and by him was left with the rest of his
books to the Bodleian in 1809.

It remains that I should express my grateful thanks to
those to whom they are due. First to the gentlemen who
have so freely put the use of their volumes at my disposal,
Mr. Blew of Warwick Street, Pall Mall, Mr. Sherbrooke of
Oxton, Southwell, Mr. Davies Cooke of Owston, Doncaster,
Dr. Gott, Vicar of Leeds, and the‘ authorities of York
Cathedral. To the first-named of these, the Reverend
William J. Blew, my special thanks are offered, for his
unwearied friendliness and ready help. To Mr. Bradshaw
also, and to the Reverend Canon Raine‚ Ι am under great
obligations: and from the Reverend Joseph Fowler of Dur·
ham, and from the Editors of the new Sarum Breviary (the
Reverend Francis Procter and the Reverend Christopher
Wordsworth), 1 have received kind assistance and an inspec-
tion of valuable materials. ,

' The following is a table of all the editions known and
copies extant of the York Breviary, with the place and date
of printing, and summary of contents.² The book is assumed
to be made up of the four component parts described in the
Introduction to Messrs. Procter and Wordsworth’s Sarum
Breviary. Pars. iii& pp. viij to xiij.
